# JavaScript30

## About
This is my repository for projects I have completed from Wes Bos's [JavaScript30 course](https://javascript30.com/).

## Goals
- Review vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by going through these courses.
- Update and adjust the existing exercises upon completion for extra practice.
- Get ideas for future apps.
- Have an app that I can work on when I don't have access to my usual machine or enough time to work on a complex project.
